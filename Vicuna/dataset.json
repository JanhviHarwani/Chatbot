Introduction  \n2. The Five Pillars of Student Success  \n   - Managing Your Professor  \n   - Becoming Part of the Community  \n   - Leveraging the Disabilities Services Office  \n   - Learning Effectively  \n   - Making Technology Work for You  \n3. Challenges and Opportunities  \n\n---\n\n Chapter 1: Introduction\nMary Alexander:  \nAnn MacDonald, in 1948, observed World War II veterans with vision loss struggling to access education through the G.I. Bill. She started recording books on the top floor of the New York City Public Library, using a Soundscriber to record onto vinyl discs. This initiative grew into a nationwide organization, which later became Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic, and ultimately Learning Ally, expanding services to students with learning disabilities.\n\n---\n\n Chapter 2: The Five Pillars of Student Success\n\n Research Insights:\nLearning Ally conducted research funded by the Lavelle Fund for the Blind, identifying key areas where visually impaired college students often face deficits. These insights formed the foundation for the Five Pillars of Student Success.\n\n---\n\n Pillar 1: Managing Your Professor\nStudents need to advocate for themselves by engaging with professors to ensure access to materials and accommodations. Advocacy skills and self-determination are critical for success.  \n\n---\n\n Pillar 2: Becoming Part of the Community\nIsolation is a major challenge for visually impaired students. Active participation in classroom and social settings helps reduce marginalization. Strategies include finding social networks and engaging with campus events.  \n\n---\n\n Pillar 3: Leveraging the Disabilities Services Office\nProactively managing accommodations through the DSO is essential. Students must understand their legal rights under the ADA and learn to navigate resources and tools effectively.  \n\n---\n\n Pillar 4: Learning Effectively\nUnderstanding personal learning needs and strategic independence is key. This involves balancing independent efforts and seeking assistance when necessary. Preparation time for studying often includes converting inaccessible materials into accessible formats.  \n\n---\n\n Pillar 5: Making Technology Work for You\nMastery of assistive technology is vital before starting college. Knowing how to use tools like screen readers, braille notetakers, and accessibility software ensures a smoother academic experience.\n\n---\n\n Chapter 3: Pillar 1: Managing Your Professor\nStudents often hesitate to approach professors due to weak advocacy skills or shyness. It\u2019s important to develop these skills before college, as effective communication can ease professor-student interactions and improve access to necessary resources.\n\n---\n\n Chapter 4: Pillar 2: Becoming Part of the Community\nSocial engagement is critical but often hindered by isolation. Students may feel hesitant to disclose their disabilities or use assistive technology in public settings. Encouraging participation in clubs and social groups can help bridge these gaps.\n\n---\n\n Chapter 5: Pillar 3: Leveraging the Disabilities Services Office\nManaging accommodations involves interacting with professors, disability services staff, and peer networks. Students need to advocate for note-taking support and ensure they receive necessary accommodations.\n\n---\n\n Chapter 6: Pillar 4: Learning Effectively\nStudents invest significant time in preparing materials for study, often requiring multiple technologies. Accessibility issues with digital materials can further increase preparation time, making time management a critical skill.\n\n---\n\n Chapter 7: Pillar 5: Making Technology Work for You\nArriving on campus with a solid grasp of assistive technology is essential. Gaps in K-12 training or insufficient funding for technology training can pose challenges. Students must familiarize themselves with college systems and advocate for accessible platforms.\n\n---\n\n Chapter 8: Challenges and Opportunities\nStudents with low vision often face unique challenges, including reluctance to self-identify as visually impaired. Social and academic integration requires both better preparation and ongoing support. Mentorship programs can provide guidance and inspiration for navigating the college experience.\n\n---\n\nFor more information about Learning Ally and the resources they provide, visit:  \n(https://learningally.org)"

        "output": "Overview:\nEye conditions are remarkably common. Those who live long enough will experience at least one eye condition during their lifetime.\nGlobally, at least 1 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. In the absence of timely detection, reduced or absent eyesight can have long-term personal and economic effects. Vision impairment affects people of all ages, with the majority being over the age of 50. Young children with early onset severe vision impairment can experience lower levels of educational achievement, and in adults it often affects quality of life through lower productivity, decreased workforce participation and high rates of depression.\nVision impairment and blindness impact the life of people everywhere. In low- and middle-income settings the burden of vision impairment can be even greater due to fewer opportunities to access the most essential eye care services.\nCataracts and uncorrected refractive errors are estimated to be the leading causes of vision impairment; however, other causes for vision impairment cannot be ignored. Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, long standing systemic conditions like diabetes causing diabetic retinopathy, infectious diseases of the eye and trauma to the eye are all equally important causes for vision impairment that need to be addressed.\n\nPrevention:\nEye conditions that can be targeted effectively with preventive strategies include congenital and acquired eye conditions, myopia, ocular trauma, and ocular infections and inflammations. A good example of this is the practice of preventative lifestyle changes among children, including a combination of increased time spent outdoors and decreased near-work activities. This may delay the onset and slow the progression of myopia, which reduces the risk of high myopia and its complications later in life.\n\nImportantly, the prevention and management of systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, can also be effective in reducing the risk of ocular diseases. In addition, interventions to prevent vitamin A deficiency, measles and rubella, through vitamin A supplementation and immunization, are highly effective in reducing the risk of corneal opacities that can occur secondary to these conditions.\n\nAnother example is the prevention of workplace ocular injuries through promoting the use of protective eye equipment (e.g., masks, protective goggles, visors etc.) during high-risk activities and industries (e.g., certain sports, agricultural activities, construction workers, welders etc.).\n\nTreatment:\nAlthough effective interventions exist to address the two leading causes of vision impairment, namely optical correction for refractive errors and surgery for cataract, there remains a large unmet need for care. Spectacles are the most common intervention used worldwide to compensate for refractive error, as well as contact lenses and refractive surgeries. Spectacles and cataract surgery are both highly cost-effective interventions that can substantially improve a person's quality of life.\n\nTreatment and care for many eye conditions, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, pterygium, amblyopia, strabismus and retinopathy of prematurity require long-term monitoring to control the progression of the condition. Treatment is also required for commonly presenting acute eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment but affect people's lives with pain and discomfort (dry eye, conjunctivitis and blepharitis, etc.). To prevent further complications, the management of these eye conditions is often directed at treating the cause or alleviating the symptoms.\n\nVision impairment that cannot be corrected or reversed requires rehabilitation measures, for which there are several available. For those who live with blindness, braille reading, counselling and home skills training, mobility training with white canes and digital assistive technologies can ensure free, independent and safe mobility.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFact sheets\n- Blindness and vision impairment\n- Assistive technology\n- Diabetes\n- Disability\n- Trachoma\n\nQuestions and answers\n- Eye care, vision impairment and blindness: Refractive errors\n\nDatabases and tools\n- WHOeyes\n- Routine health information systems \u2013 sensory functions toolkit\n\nInitiatives and groups\n- SPECS 2030\n- Global SPECS Network\n\nResolutions and decisions\n- Integrated people-centred eye care, including preventable vision impairment and blindness (WHA74.12)\n- Integrated people-centred eye care, including preventable vision impairment and blindness (WHA73.4)\n- Towards universal eye health: a global action plan 2014\u20132019 (WHA66.4)\n- Prevention of avoidable blindness and visual impairment (WHA62.1)\n- Prevention of avoidable blindness and visual impairment (WHA59.25)\n- Elimination of avoidable blindness (WHA56.26)\n- Global elimination of blinding trachoma (WHA51.11)\n\nTechnical work\n- Noncommunicable Diseases\n- Sensory Functions, Disability and Rehabilitation"

        "output": "Content:\n\nABOUT BLINDNESS\n--------------\nMost people consider blindness to be synonymous with helplessness, witlessness and hopelessness. Paradoxically, the blind are also often imagined to possess special gifts, powers, talents or capacities that somehow compensate them for their \"affliction\". In either case, the blind are placed in a class apart from the rest of humanity.\n\nIt is the experience of the members of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) that these notions of blindness are false and damaging to the quest of the blind to take their rightful place in society. Accordingly, it is the aim of the National Federation of the Blind to do nothing less than to eradicate society's false notions and negative stereotypes of blindness and the blind and to replace them with the knowledge and expectation that the blind are simply normal people who cannot see and that with training and opportunity, the blind can compete on terms of equality with everyone else and can live normal, happy, productive lives.\n\nTENETS OF NFB'S PHILOSOPHY\n-------------------------\n\u2022 The real problem of blindness is not the lack of eyesight; it is the misconceptions about blindness held by society.\n\n\u2022 The blind are neither especially cursed nor especially blessed; they are normal people who cannot see.\n\n\u2022 With training and opportunity, blindness can be reduced to the level of a physical nuisance or inconvenience.\n\n\u2022 With training and opportunity, the average blind person can perform the average job in the average workplace as well as can his/her sighted colleagues.\n\n\u2022 The blind are a minority within society and virtually all of the problems of blindness are those experienced by other minorities within society, e.g., discriminatory treatment and lack of acceptance as persons of equal standing with the rest of society.\n\nCORE BELIEF\n----------\nIn essence, NFB's philosophy of blindness amounts to the knowledge that it is respectable to be blind.\n\nAdditionally, we of the NFB believe that we, the blind, can adapt to the world, requiring few modifications to function effectively in the world as it is.\n\nThe National Federation of the Blind knows that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or your future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams. You can have the life you want; blindness is not what holds you back.\n\nRESOURCES\n---------\nBelow are links to articles further elucidating this NFB philosophy of blindness.

If they're staring at you at a party, they may want to strike up a conversation.\n\nAccording to a renowned 1971 study by Albert Mehrabian, now-professor emeritus of pscychology at the University of California-Los Angeles, nonverbal interactions like these comprise about 90% of our communication with others. Eye contact, Mehrabian found, is a universal language of social interactions we can all understand \u2014 that is, unless you can't see.\n\nFor college students with visual impairments, this makes it difficult to get the full college experience outside the classroom. Since the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, professors across the nation have been legally required to accommodate college students who are blind, which means accessing a syllabus or finding a scribe for an exam is no longer the pressing issue.\n\nThe problem is that the unspoken social college curriculum -- one that holds some truly valuable life lessons -- is not easily accessible to individuals who are blind or have low vision.\n\nKey Insights from Educators:\n-------------------------\n\"The resources are great, but they aren't helping people who are blind navigate the college experience \u2014 they're just helping them navigate the classroom experience, and that's not what college is about,\" Mickey Damelio, a teacher for the visually impaired at Florida State University, says.\n\nStudent Experiences:\n-----------------\nConnor Boss, a legally blind student at Florida State University, shares her experiences:\n- Has had her fair share of social mishaps\n- Prefers to keep her blindness under wraps due to her disability not being physically detectable\n- Active member of her sorority\n- Member of the competitive advertising team\n- Secretary of disability affairs for student government\n\nCommon Challenges:\n---------------\n1. Transportation Issues:\n   - Must rely on friends or public transportation\n   - Can lead to limited social participation\n   - Creates feelings of being a burden\n\n2. Social Communication:\n   - Difficulty with non-verbal cues\n   - Challenges in social settings\n   - Missing visual information in interactions\n\n3. Incidental Learning:\n   - Missing untaught social skills\n   - Limited opportunities for certain experiences\n   - Gaps in social development\n\nProposed Solutions:\n----------------\nVision Teachers:\n- Help students learn necessary social skills\n- Ensure similar college experiences as sighted students\n- Fill gaps in social development\n- Provide guidance for life skills beyond academics\n\nExpert Conclusion:\n---------------\n\"They do everything they can on the academic side, but leave all the life stuff aside. It's just too messy,\" Damelio says.\n\nAbout the Author:\n---------------\nDaniella Abinum is a student at Florida State University and a fall 2015 USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent.\n\nNote: This story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.

        "output": "Content:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n-----------\nSince its inception, the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB) has served as the leading source of information and research encompassing blindness and low vision in the United States. This information not only educates those experiencing blindness or difficulty seeing, but it also informs thought leaders, policymakers, and practitioners who work each day to expand opportunity and inclusion for people who are blind or have low vision everywhere.\n\nSTATISTICAL RESOURCES\n-------------------\nAn essential resource from the American Foundation for the Blind is our Statistical Snapshots, which is a one-stop source providing a wide variety of information and tools addressing the most commonly asked questions relating to blindness and vision loss.\n\nUNDERSTANDING THE SPECTRUM OF BLINDNESS\n------------------------------------\nWhile many may think of blindness as a complete loss of sight, the reality is that it exists across a wide spectrum, with most people still retaining some vision. Traditionally, those with significant sight loss have been referred to as being \"visually impaired.\" However, many factors result in a person's difficulty seeing, and not all are directly related to the eyes. For this reason, AFB, along with others in the field, considers sight loss to fall within this spectrum, ranging from total blindness to low vision resulting from a wide range of conditions. While there are many similarities, every individual's situation is unique, and the pathway to independence can differ for each person.\n\nIMPACT AND INDEPENDENCE\n---------------------\nThe degree by which an individual's loss of sight occurs can significantly impact their ability to function independently when performing daily routines. Just because a person may experience blindness or low vision does not mean that they cannot live a fulfilling and independent life. Through appropriate support, such as training and rehabilitation, people who are blind or have low vision can live just as freely as anyone else. Thanks to advancements in assistive technology, the hurdles of losing one of the body's major sense perceptions can be supplemented. From traditional aids like tactile reading with braille to advanced artificially intelligent (AI) devices that help navigate streets, the barriers often resulting from blindness continue to be broken down by those innovating solutions for independence.\n\nADDRESSING MISCONCEPTIONS\n-----------------------\nMisconceptions and stereotypes are often the biggest obstacles to equal opportunity and full inclusion for individuals with blindness or low vision. The more we know and understand, the more we can dismantle this significant social barrier, fostering a more inclusive and understanding society.\n\nRESOURCES FOR LIVING WITH VISION LOSS\n-----------------------------------\nAFB's Statistical Snapshots\n- Your one-stop source for statistical facts, figures, and resources about Americans with vision loss.\n\nGuide to Eye Conditions\n- A brief overview of conditions that are the cause of blindness or visual impairment.\n\nUsing Technology\n- A round-up of issues related to technology for visually impaired and blind people\n- Includes AFB's acclaimed online technology magazine AccessWorld\u00ae\n- Offers objective reviews of mainstream and assistive technology products\n\nBraille\n- Overview of braille and literacy\n- Resources for finding braille publications\n- The Braille Bug\u00ae, an interactive website for kids\n\nPARTNER RESOURCES\n---------------\nLosing Your Sight?\nVisionAware\u2122, now stewarded by the American Printing House for the Blind, is a comprehensive resource for basic information about adjusting to vision loss, including tips for adapting your home and daily living. There's also extensive information and support for senior citizens who are losing vision, as well as their family members and caregivers.\n\nFor Parents of Children Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired\nOriginally created by AFB and the National Association for Parents of Children with Visual Impairments, FamilyConnect\u00ae offers information and an interactive community for parents of children with visual impairments, with resources to help navigate infancy to the teenage years.\n\nFor Job Seekers\nCareerConnect\u00ae is your guide to the working world as a blind or visually impaired person.

        "output": "Content:\n\nSTUDENT EXPERIENCE\n-----------------\nUpon arriving at Perkins School for the Blind's College Success program last fall, Steph Brown had never, in 18 years growing up in Stillwater, Minn., crossed a street alone.\n\n\"I have no vision whatsoever,\" Brown said, and this presented fundamental challenges in school \u2014 like getting to the building in the first place and then from class to class, and learning Braille to be able to read along and finish assignments. Often, Brown relied on family and friends to help negotiate some of the everyday tasks that sighted people can take for granted.\n\nAs Brown reached high school, it came time to think about college, including the notion of pursuing an education outside of Minnesota. But the prospect of going anywhere alone was already daunting enough. Hurdle after hurdle popped up in Brown's mind before even beginning to think about what college might be a good fit.\n\nPERSONAL REFLECTION\n------------------\n\"You know that meme 'This Is Fine,' where the dog's sitting in a room drinking a cup of coffee, smiling, but the surrounding room is on fire?\" Brown asks. \"I don't know how many times I've said that, you know, that 'I am fine,' but felt that way.\"\n\nPROGRAM CONTEXT\n--------------\nBrown is not alone in feeling like the world is burning, especially when it comes to visually impaired students who are thinking about entering America's higher education system. According to Perkins, about 60 percent of blind or visually impaired students who pursue postsecondary education programs fail to graduate. The vast leap needed to acquire both academic achievement and independent living skills, which include day-to-day getting around, housework, and time management, is often too great for these young adults to successfully complete.\n\nPROGRAM DESCRIPTION\n------------------\nPerkins is trying to shorten this leap and build bridges to opportunity through College Success, which, in May, graduated its first cohort of eight students from seven states nationwide. In collaboration with the Harvard Extension School, the program prepares students to live on their own for the first time, helping them find the right school and giving them the academic skills they'll need to stay there.\n\nSTUDENT QUOTE\n------------\n\"You know that meme 'This Is Fine,' where the dog's sitting in a room drinking a cup of coffee, smiling, but the surrounding room is on fire? I don't know how many times I've said that, you know, that 'I am fine,' but felt that way.\"\n- Steph Brown, graduate of the College Success program\n\nPROGRAM DIRECTOR'S PERSPECTIVE\n----------------------------\n\"There's not enough time in four years of high school to teach all of the skills necessary to adapt [to an independent higher education experience], and that independence when you're in college is essential,\" explained College Success Director Leslie Thatcher, A.M. '95. \"Introducing these future young professionals to tools that they will use for the rest of their lives, and then empowering them with the confidence and the ability to articulate what their needs and desires are, like every other human being, is the essence of what these nine months is about.\"\n\nContinuing with the Harvard article:\n\nSTUDENT SPOTLIGHT: JORDAN SCHEFFER\n--------------------------------\nAnother of the impressive eight to complete College Success' inaugural year is Asheville, N.C., native Jordan Scheffer, an aspiring musician who once took second place at Amateur Night at the Apollo, and who came to Perkins specifically to acquire independent living skills.\n\n\"I think when I came in August, I wanted to travel on my own, but wondered, 'Oh, how do I do this?'\" she said. \"And I was very nervous. But throughout these nine months I've become so much more independent, and I've also become more able to express what I need and why I need it, which I'm still working on.\" On a recent trip to a nearby mall, an emboldened Scheffer left the group she was traveling with to do some exploring, and shopping, on her own.\n\nACADEMIC PROGRAM DETAILS\n----------------------\nThatcher said both Scheffer and Brown had strong academic backgrounds before arriving at Perkins, yet they both benefited significantly from their first taste of college-level coursework, which they completed at the Extension School. During their first semester, students in College Success enrolled in EXPO-E25, \"Academic Writing and Critical Reading,\" and they were also able to sign up for electives of their own choosing, both in person and online. Brown took an introduction to fiction writing course that culminated in writing a piece \"looking at myself some years into the future,\" as well as another class on self and identity; Scheffer signed up for the writing class, as well as a course on grammar. She also took intro to psychology, which she attended at Harvard's Science Center using Uber to get back and forth from Perkins' Watertown campus.\n\nCREATIVE PROJECT HIGHLIGHT\n------------------------\nScheffer, who will attend UNC Asheville in the fall, said her favorite project from her Extension School classes required her to analyze people \"in public doing something, and to make inferences on why they were doing what they were doing.\" To do this, she went to a coffee shop with a sighted friend, and used an app called Be My Eyes to observe fellow patrons by connecting with sighted volunteers.\n\n\"I love quote-unquote people-watching,\" she explained. \"I write creatively, with characters, and it's fun for me to get to analyze behavior and infer why it's going on. This, I think, gives me a lot of basis for putting behavior into stories, but also for learning about human beings and why they do what they do in what circumstances. I think that's really interesting.\"\n\nSUPPORT SERVICES\n---------------\nAccessibility Services at Harvard's Division of Continuing Education (DCE) worked hand-in-hand with Perkins throughout the year to make sure class experiences like Scheffer's were as seamless as possible by ensuring that all cohort members had equal access to courses, providing various formats online (refreshable Braille displays, electronic text, and screen readers, for example), thinking carefully about how students would navigate the physical campus when taking classes in person, and helping them map out the routes. According to DCE Executive Director for Accessibility Services Linda Sullivan, the Extension School regularly provides these services to all students who need them.\n\nIMPACT AND SIGNIFICANCE\n----------------------\n\"From someone who has been in accessibility services in higher education for a long time,\" she said, \"it's so nice to see people thinking about the transition from high school to college. Perkins is taking the necessary steps to help people who may at one time have been considered unable to be successful in school and giving them the chance to say no, they can be successful. This does so much for the students. It means so much for Harvard to be involved, and it makes the world a better place, truthfully.\"\n\nPROGRAM COLLABORATION\n-------------------\n\"Our relationship with the Extension School has been amazing,\" added Thatcher. \"The disability service office was extraordinarily supportive, both to us as the team and to the students. And Dean Huntington D. Lambert has been a particularly significant supporter of us from a philosophical standpoint, from a just 'Let's make this happen' kind of attitude which has been really valuable for us. He's been a great partner. \u2026 The classes have been rich, dynamic, challenging opportunities for these students.\"\n\nSTUDENT SUCCESS\n--------------\nBrown is quick to point to the academic portion of College Success, saying, \"Expo 25 showed me that college-level work is very, very different\" \u2014 and admitting there were some very real learning curves during the year. Still, Brown is flourishing enough to stay in the Boston area this coming year, having been accepted into Lesley University and planning to major in education or psychology.\n\nAnd by the way, Brown has crossed a street alone and then some, using newfound confidence and budding orientation and mobility skills to successfully navigate the journey from Boston all the way to Provincetown, by bus and ferry."

        "output": "Content:\n\nDOCUMENT INFORMATION\n------------------\nPrepared August 2017, Updated February 2024\n\nVISION TERMS\n-----------\nFunctional limitation\nRefers to the interaction of visual functioning and ability to perform activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living. Daily activities potentially affected by vision loss are reading, safe pedestrian travel, self-care, cooking, and recreational activities.\n\nLegal blindness\nIs a level of vision loss that has been legally defined to determine eligibility for benefits. In the United States, this refers to a medically diagnosed central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the best possible correction, and/or a visual field of 20 degrees or less. See the Blue Book Disability Evaluation Under Social Security. Often, people who are diagnosed with legal blindness still have some usable vision.\n\nLow vision\nDescribes \"a person who has measurable vision but has difficulty accomplishing or cannot accomplish visual tasks even with prescribed corrective lenses but who can enhance his or her ability to accomplish these tasks with the use of compensatory visual strategies, low vision devices, and environmental modifications\" (Corn & Lusk, 2010, p. 4-5).\n\nSelf-reported vision loss\nIs determined on an individual basis based on that person's perceived visual ability and its effect on daily functioning.\n\nTotal blindness\nRefers to an inability to see anything with either eye.\n\nVision difficulty\nRefers to individuals who self-report that they \"are blind or have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses.\"\n\nVision loss\nRefers to individuals who report that they \"have [a little or a lot of] trouble seeing, even when wearing glasses or contact lenses,\" as well as to individuals who \"are blind or unable to see at all.\"\n\nVisual acuity\nIs the \"measure of an eye's ability to distinguish object details and shape, [it is] typically assessed by the smallest identifiable object that can be seen at a specified distance (usually 20 feet or 16 inches)\" (Cassin, , p. 24). Typical vision is 20/20. If an individual sees 20/200, the smallest letter that this individual can see at 20 feet could be seen by someone with typical vision at 200 feet.\n\nVisual impairment/visual disability\nIs \"a term that encompasses both those who are blind and those with low vision\" (Corn & Lusk, 2010, p. 13). Additional factors influencing visual impairment might be contrast sensitivity, light sensitivity, glare sensitivity, and light/dark adaptation.\n\nSTATISTICAL TERMS\n----------------\nFrequency\nIs the number of people who were similar for a given characteristic within a given time period. For example, in 2015, 23.7 million adult Americans reported vision loss.\n\nPrevalence\nIs a measurement of the proportion of individuals in a population affected by a condition within a particular period of time. Prevalence indicates how widespread a condition is. Prevalence is typically expressed as a percentage. For example, according to the 2014 National Health Interview Survey, 14.5% of adults (ages 18 and up) with vision difficulty also experienced difficulty hearing.\n\nIncidence\nIs a measurement of the number of new individuals who develop a condition during a particular period of time. Incidence conveys information about the risk of developing the condition. For example, the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity \"varies with birth weight but is reported to be approximately 50-70% in infants whose weight is less than 1250 g at birth\" (Subramanian, 2015).\n\nEMPLOYMENT TERMS\n---------------\nWhen discussing employment, there are four commonly used figures: unemployment rate, labor force participation rate, percentage not in the labor force, and employment-population ratio. Since it would be impossible to count and identify everyone who is employed and unemployed in the United States at a single point in time, these figures are reported as estimates, usually based on a survey of a randomly sampled portion of the population.\n\nThe unemployment rate\nAs calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), is the percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment and willing to work. Since the unemployment rate is calculated as a fraction of the labor force, it does not count individuals who are considered \"not in the labor force\" - those who are not looking for work, whether they never sought employment, they left the workforce for retirement, or they dropped out of the workforce because of disability or long-term unemployment (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017).\n\nThe labor force participation rate\nAs defined by the BLS, is \"the percentage of the population that is either employed or unemployed (that is, either working or actively seeking work)\" (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014).\n\nThe percentage not in the labor force\nAccounts for the proportion of the total population (ages 16 and up) that has either dropped out of the labor force or never entered it. This number is typically higher than the unemployment rate and, when added to the unemployment rate, provides a more accurate picture of the proportion of people who are not employed (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017).\n\nThe employment-population ratio\n(Commonly confused with the employment rate) is the percentage of the total population that is employed, where the total population includes people working, people actively seeking work, and people who have dropped out of the labor force or never entered it (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016).\n\nAs a reminder, the Census Bureau and BLS determine these estimates for the civilian, non-institutionalized population.\n\nREFERENCES\n----------\nBureau of Labor Statistics.

        "output": "Content:\nThe Mobile Revolution\nIf you've ever watched an episode of Star Trek, you will doubtless recall how the crew of the Starship Enterprise was able to keep in touch with each other by means of a small device, called a communicator, attached to their uniforms, and to access data and a galaxy of other information via hand-held tricorders. In the 60s, 70s, and 80s, this was far-in-the-future, pipedream, science-fiction stuff. But in the early 90s, science fiction started becoming reality with the introduction of mobile phones. By the early 2000s, we regularly communicated on the go using Short Message Service (SMS) text messages, and soon e-mail and Web browsing capabilities were added to our cell phones, which we dubbed \"smartphones.\"\n\nOver the past several years the number of smartphone users has exploded. The capabilities of these devices have doubled and redoubled, so that today we can carry a device in our pocket that has more processing power and memory storage than that possessed by the world's fastest supercomputers of just a few decades ago. Today you can check your e-mail, the weather forecast, or a stock quote on your mobile device. Want to know which movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973? Speak to your smartphone and ask the question, from anywhere, and in a second or so you'll have the answer: The Sting, starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Want to watch it? Use your smartphone to log onto Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, or another online video streaming service and you can watch it right on your phone. You could also choose to view The Sting on a touch tablet like the iPad, which includes most of the capabilities and features of a smartphone with a larger display.\n\nIf you've used a smartphone these past several years, you already know that a great deal of voice command capabilities come built in to most current models, so you can verbally instruct your smartphone to \"Call my wife,\" or \"Read my last text message.\" In addition, the three major smartphone platforms\u2014Apple iOS, Google Android, and Microsoft Windows Phone\u2014all include built-in screen readers similar to those that allow you to use your PC or Mac computer with little or even no vision. So, now you can read a webpage, compose an e-mail, or use your phone's GPS function to help you find the nearest coffee shop.\n\nMost smartphones have replaced a majority of their physical buttons and other controls with visual icons that appear on a smooth glass touchscreen. You use a finger to select and activate these icons, and to enter phone numbers, messages, and other text via visual representations of keyboards and number pads. At first glance, so to speak, a touchscreen would appear to present insurmountable difficulties for those with visual impairments. You may be saying to yourself, \"On my home phone I can still feel my way across, up, and down the keypad to dial a number. How can I find the right number on a flat piece of glass?\"\n\nThis guide will show you exactly how this is possible. By the time you finish, you will feel empowered to use your smartphone in new ways or to purchase your first smartphone and enjoy a world of data and communications you can carry with you everywhere.\n\nFirst we'll take a look at some new technology for an old friend\u2014that trusty clamshell or candy-bar style feature phone.\n\nUsing a Feature Phone with a Visual Impairment or Blindness\nSome of us want a mobile phone to function primarily as a phone, giving us the ability to simply make or answer calls on the go. Some people may not be able to, or may not want to, afford the extra cost of a wireless data connection, which nearly all mobile phone companies insist upon in order to use any smartphone model. It is still possible to get a simple phone that will make and receive phone calls without all of the bells and whistles associated with a smartphone. These types of devices are called feature phones, and usually offer the ability to make and receive phone calls and send and receive SMS text messages. Most feature phones come in one of two configurations:\n\nThe flip or clamshell feature phone: these phones fold in half like a makeup compact and include a display screen on one half and a regular pushbutton dial pad on the other.\nThe candy-bar feature phone: these phones are usually longer and slimmer than flip phones, with the screen and dial pad on the same face. Some candy-bar phones also include a slide-out pushbutton keyboard that allows you to type faster than if you were to use the number pad.\nMany feature phones include at least some accessibility controls designed to accommodate the needs of those with visual impairments. For some manufacturers these accommodations are limited to raised dots placed on the 5 number key to help orient your fingers on the keypad, and perhaps a few rudimentary voice commands such as \"Call home\" or \"What time is it?\"\n\nAccessible Feature Phones for People with Visual Impairments\nAt the time of this guide's publication, three feature phones stood out for their accessibility.\n\nThe Kyocera Kona\nOffered by Sprint/T-Mobile, the Kona flip phone is also available either with or without a contract. Read a review of the Kyocera Kona in AFB AccessWorld.\n\nThe Kyocera Verve\nOffered by Sprint/T-Mobile, the Verve candy-bar style phone is also available either with or without a contract. The Verve offers a slide out keyboard for those who wish to text frequently with accessibility. Read a review of the Kyocera Verve in AFB AccessWorld.\n\nThe Odin VI\nThe Odin VI from Odin Mobile, a third-party cell provider that specializes in serving those with visual impairments, is a candy-bar style phone with a slide-out keypad. Read a review of the Odin VI in AFB AccessWorld.\n\nFeature Phone Accessibility: Voice Guidance\nEach of the three phones mentioned above includes a voice guide that can be turned on via the phone's Settings menu. You will likely need sighted help for the initial setup, but after that the phone will speak every time you turn it on.\n\nAt first you may find the voice a bit mechanical and difficult to understand. Fear not. You can adjust the speed of the voice and its tone, and after a short time you will grow so accustomed to the speech, you will likely decide to increase its speed.\n\nWith your phone's voice guide enabled, you will be able to hear phone numbers as you dial them, and caller ID for incoming calls will be voiced aloud as well. You will be able to add names and phone numbers to your contact list for quicker dialing, and to use the built-in calendar to keep track of appointments.\n\nThe full-featured voice guides in these phones will read your text messages and allow you to compose and send outgoing messages.\n\nBecause the world is moving toward smartphones with always-on data connections, as accessible as the accessible feature phones mentioned above are, it is likely that they represent the end of the line. Even if you decide that a feature phone will suit your needs completely, we encourage you to read on. When you learn what's possible, you may decide that you are ready, willing, and\u2014most exciting of all\u2014able to take the plunge and begin using a touchscreen smartphone or tablet."

        "output": "Content:\nA video magnifier, or closed-circuit television (CCTV) system, uses a stand-mounted or handheld video camera to project a magnified image onto a video monitor, a television (TV) screen, or a computer monitor. Cameras with zoom lenses provide variable magnification. In most of these systems, magnification level and focus are set after choosing a comfortable and functional working distance between the camera and the material to be viewed. Some systems use an auto-focus camera. Lower cost video magnifiers often use cameras that have a fixed focus and cannot vary magnification or camera-to-target distance. Most cameras also need their own light source.\nCameras that are mounted on a fixed stand require the reading material to be placed under the camera and moved across and down the page. To make the process of viewing easier, a table that is movable from the top of the page to the bottom and side to side (referred to as an x-y table) is used with most stand-mounted cameras. Stand-mounted cameras are particularly effective for handwriting because a hand can fit under the camera.\nIn contrast to stand-mounted cameras, handheld cameras are designed for bringing the camera to the material to be viewed. They can magnify almost anything within reach, including labels on packages of food and medicine. Handheld cameras are often on rollers, which make them easier to move across a flat working surface. Some manufacturers of video magnifiers that use handheld cameras offer a writing stand as an accessory.\nAll video magnifiers offer the option of viewing black letters on a white background or white letters on a black background. Controls for contrast and brightness are also standard. Many video magnifiers also provide other special on-screen features and controls including underlining or overlining of text. Some systems work jointly with a computer, offering the option of sharing the computer monitor. Color video magnifiers are useful for reading materials in which color is crucial, such as maps and color photographs. A radical departure in design from conventional video magnifiers is the use of head-mounted displays (HMD). They offer portability and new ways of viewing the display. Being able to capture and save an image is also a new function that has recently become available.\nTypically, video magnifiers that use a camera mounted on a fixed stand and x-y table are in the $1,800 to $4,000 price range. Lower cost video magnifiers that plug into a TV are in the $400 to $1,000 price range.\nAcrobat Ultra LCD\nVideo magnifier that features a 3-in-1 camera for seeing one's self up close, reading, and distance viewing. Comes with 20\", 22\", 24\", or 27\" high-resolution LCD monitors that provide 1.6x to 99.5x adjustable magnification (varies with LCD size).

Cameras with zoom lenses provide variable magnification. In most of these systems, magnification level and focus are set after choosing a comfortable and functional working distance between the camera and the material to be viewed. Some systems use an auto-focus camera. Lower cost video magnifiers often use cameras that have a fixed focus and cannot vary magnification or camera-to-target distance. Most cameras also need their own light source.\nCameras that are mounted on a fixed stand require the reading material to be placed under the camera and moved across and down the page. To make the process of viewing easier, a table that is movable from the top of the page to the bottom and side to side (referred to as an x-y table) is used with most stand-mounted cameras. Stand-mounted cameras are particularly effective for handwriting because a hand can fit under the camera.\nIn contrast to stand-mounted cameras, handheld cameras are designed for bringing the camera to the material to be viewed. They can magnify almost anything within reach, including labels on packages of food and medicine. Handheld cameras are often on rollers, which make them easier to move across a flat working surface. Some manufacturers of video magnifiers that use handheld cameras offer a writing stand as an accessory.\nAll video magnifiers offer the option of viewing black letters on a white background or white letters on a black background. Controls for contrast and brightness are also standard. Many video magnifiers also provide other special on-screen features and controls including underlining or overlining of text. Some systems work jointly with a computer, offering the option of sharing the computer monitor. Color video magnifiers are useful for reading materials in which color is crucial, such as maps and color photographs. A radical departure in design from conventional video magnifiers is the use of head-mounted displays (HMD). They offer portability and new ways of viewing the display. Being able to capture and save an image is also a new function that has recently become available.\nTypically, video magnifiers that use a camera mounted on a fixed stand and x-y table are in the $1,800 to $4,000 price range. Lower cost video magnifiers that plug into a TV are in the $400 to $1,000 price range.\nAcrobat Ultra LCD\nVideo magnifier that features a 3-in-1 camera for seeing one's self up close, reading, and distance viewing.

Cameras with zoom lenses provide variable magnification. In most of these systems, magnification level and focus are set after choosing a comfortable and functional working distance between the camera and the material to be viewed. Some systems use an auto-focus camera. Lower cost video magnifiers often use cameras that have a fixed focus and cannot vary magnification or camera-to-target distance. Most cameras also need their own light source.\nCameras that are mounted on a fixed stand require the reading material to be placed under the camera and moved across and down the page. To make the process of viewing easier, a table that is movable from the top of the page to the bottom and side to side (referred to as an x-y table) is used with most stand-mounted cameras. Stand-mounted cameras are particularly effective for handwriting because a hand can fit under the camera.\nIn contrast to stand-mounted cameras, handheld cameras are designed for bringing the camera to the material to be viewed. They can magnify almost anything within reach, including labels on packages of food and medicine. Handheld cameras are often on rollers, which make them easier to move across a flat working surface. Some manufacturers of video magnifiers that use handheld cameras offer a writing stand as an accessory.\nAll video magnifiers offer the option of viewing black letters on a white background or white letters on a black background. Controls for contrast and brightness are also standard. Many video magnifiers also provide other special on-screen features and controls including underlining or overlining of text. Some systems work jointly with a computer, offering the option of sharing the computer monitor. Color video magnifiers are useful for reading materials in which color is crucial, such as maps and color photographs. A radical departure in design from conventional video magnifiers is the use of head-mounted displays (HMD). They offer portability and new ways of viewing the display. Being able to capture and save an image is also a new function that has recently become available.\nTypically, video magnifiers that use a camera mounted on a fixed stand and x-y table are in the $1,800 to $4,000 price range. Lower cost video magnifiers that plug into a TV are in the $400 to $1,000 price range.\nAcrobat Ultra LCD\nVideo magnifier that features a 3-in-1 camera for seeing one's self up close, reading, and distance viewing.

Cameras with zoom lenses provide variable magnification. In most of these systems, magnification level and focus are set after choosing a comfortable and functional working distance between the camera and the material to be viewed. Some systems use an auto-focus camera. Lower cost video magnifiers often use cameras that have a fixed focus and cannot vary magnification or camera-to-target distance. Most cameras also need their own light source.\nCameras that are mounted on a fixed stand require the reading material to be placed under the camera and moved across and down the page. To make the process of viewing easier, a table that is movable from the top of the page to the bottom and side to side (referred to as an x-y table) is used with most stand-mounted cameras. Stand-mounted cameras are particularly effective for handwriting because a hand can fit under the camera.\nIn contrast to stand-mounted cameras, handheld cameras are designed for bringing the camera to the material to be viewed. They can magnify almost anything within reach, including labels on packages of food and medicine. Handheld cameras are often on rollers, which make them easier to move across a flat working surface. Some manufacturers of video magnifiers that use handheld cameras offer a writing stand as an accessory.\nAll video magnifiers offer the option of viewing black letters on a white background or white letters on a black background. Controls for contrast and brightness are also standard. Many video magnifiers also provide other special on-screen features and controls including underlining or overlining of text. Some systems work jointly with a computer, offering the option of sharing the computer monitor. Color video magnifiers are useful for reading materials in which color is crucial, such as maps and color photographs. A radical departure in design from conventional video magnifiers is the use of head-mounted displays (HMD). They offer portability and new ways of viewing the display. Being able to capture and save an image is also a new function that has recently become available.\nTypically, video magnifiers that use a camera mounted on a fixed stand and x-y table are in the $1,800 to $4,000 price range. Lower cost video magnifiers that plug into a TV are in the $400 to $1,000 price range.\nAcrobat Ultra LCD\nVideo magnifier that features a 3-in-1 camera for seeing one's self up close, reading, and distance viewing.

        "output": "content:\nElectronic Notetakers (Braille)\nElectronic notetakers are small, portable devices for storing information with the use of braille or typewriter keyboards. The stored information may be accessed through a built-in speech synthesizer, a braille display, or both. In the past, similar devices that were less powerful and less versatile were referred to as braille notetakers, which were used for storing names and telephone numbers, keeping track of appointments, and taking notes. In addition to these functions, the latest electronic notetakers provide advanced word processing, web browsing, and other functions. At one time, these devices were referred to as \"accessible PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) because they allowed users to perform most of the functions of a standard PDA. Since smartphones and tablets (like the iPad) have become so prevalent, most people in the general public no longer use PDAs, so we have returned to the term electronic notetaker even though the device allows the user to do so much more than just take notes.\n\nElectronic notetakers allow you to get rid of a lot of scraps of paper or cassette tapes you have used for trying to keep track of information. No electronic notetaker with a screen has been developed for people with low vision, so a person with low vision should consider an electronic notetaker with speech output. Someone who knows braille will probably be more comfortable using a device with braille output. For your convenience, electronic notetakers with braille and speech output are listed separately here from electronic notetakers with speech output only.\n\nCurrent electronic notetakers are based on Microsoft\u2019s Windows CE operating system, a version of Windows specifically designed for handheld computers. They generally include a simple word processor, calendar, address list, and e-mail functions. Data entered into an electronic notetaker may be transferred to a larger computer with more memory, reviewed using the built-in speech synthesizer or braille display, or printed on a braille or ink print printer. A basic electronic notetaker without a braille display costs between $2,000 and $3,000. An electronic notetaker with a braille display is typically double the price.\n\nThere are a number of questions to ask when purchasing electronic notetakers, including the following:\n\nHow does the electronic notetaker connect to your system?\nDoes it have expandable memory?\nIs add-on software available for it?\nDo you require multi-language support?\nDo you need one-handed mode?\nActive Braille\nFirst 40-character braille display with patented ATC technology. Powerful notetaker on which one can also store hundreds of books and allows for automatic scrolling of the Bookworm mode. Also offers wireless Bluetooth connectivity for use with computers and mobile devices and braille keyboard allows for the entry of text directly from Active Braille.\n\nBasic Braille\nPlain and portable braille display equipped with 40 braille cells. Also available with 64, 80 and 84 braille elements. Its flexible design made it possible to create various versions that cover a wide range of possible applications. The 40-braille-elements version is ideal to be used with a laptop computer and the 64-braille-element version fits a standard computer keyboard. All versions have a flat design and can be comfortably placed in front of a computer keyboard or laptop.\n\nBraille Plus 18 Second Generation\nNotetaker that combines a high-quality braille keyboard and refreshable braille display with an advanced mobile platform and specialized accessible software to create the world's first Android smartphone designed for blind students and professionals.\n\nBraille Sense U2\nNotetaker that allows user to create and read documents in any of five languages and use multiple bilingual dictionaries, highlight points with advanced font and style options; provide complete and up-to-date access email with IMAP access and open EML files directly from the File Manager, and secure valuable information with file encryption. Also offers fraction calculation and Nemeth Braille code entry into a fully functional scientific calculator. Unique built-in LCD allows sighted teachers and parents to view a student\u2019s progress while using Braille Sense U2. Provides clear and powerful stereo audio listening experience with easily accessible audio buttons and 11 equalizer settings and control of FM Radio, DAISY Player and Media Player with designated media buttons located on the front of the unit. Available in 18-cell and 32-cell versions and a QWERTY-style keyboard.\n\nBraille to Go (B2G)\nA 20-cell, 8-dot braille lightweight (20.3 ounces) notetaker that offers a respectable array of connectivity features. Based on the Android 4.2 (Jellybean), the B2G can be used alone or connected to an iOS or Android phone. Hardware features include 802.11g Wi-Fi networking. Bluetooth, USB host, and micro-USB ports, a 5-MP camera for OCR, an SD card slot, stereo microphone, and stereo speakers. NBP estimates that the 5400nMh battery should last one to two days under normal use. A slot provides support for GSM or CDMA wireless radio (not yet available and sold separately).\n\nBrailleNote Touch\nNotetaker that allows user to enter braille on the touch screen, guided by HumanWare's patent-pending TouchBraille calibration system, which intelligently determines where one\u2019s fingers are on screen, and which dot combinations are being made with them. The BrailleNote Touch is 10 inches wide, with braille cells in front, and a 7-inch touchscreen behind the cells. To the left and right of the 7-inch screen are additional touch-sensitive areas available for braille input. If you would rather enter braille with traditional keys, put the notetaker in the included Smart Case, which is topped by buttons that activate the touch surface, when used to enter braille. Like HumanWare's other braille devices, the BrailleNote Touch uses a version of the KeySoft operating environment. Though familiar, the new KeySoft has been rewritten to support the advanced features of the new device. The device features two USB ports, an SD card slot, and HDMI port. Also features an 8 MP camera, a pair of stereo speakers, 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a GPS receiver, and an accelerometer. It is also Google Play certified, which means its specifications match those of standard Google-approved tablets.\n\nBraillino with Bluetooth\nBraille PDA that can be connected to off-the-shelf mobile phones and organizers to provide access to functions such as text messaging and e-mail. May be used with a docking station.\n\nCanute Electronic Braille Reader\nMulti-line device that the developers hope can become a \"Kindle for blind people.\" The Mk8 prototype, available for hands-on demos at CSUN, is about the size of a desktop scanner, and features eight lines of 32 braille cells each equivalent to 256 cells per page, at a cost estimated by Bristol Braille of $3 per cell. The Canute isn't a braille display, but a reading-oriented device to which you add BRF files via USB. The multi-line design makes the device an interesting option for viewing tabular information such as a calendar, or computer code.\n\nElBraille\nFull mobile portable computer running on Windows 10 together with Jaws for Windows. It contains a docking station, integrated with Freedom Scientific\u2019s Focus 14 Braille display. This docking station contains the Perkin\u2019s style keyboard and all the navigation options found on the Focus 14.\n\nNeoBraille\nA 32-cell, 8-dot Android-based unit that sports 3 GB of RAM, 64 GB flash memory, AT&T LTE, 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, two USB ports, and a mini-HDMI port. Weighs in at 1.5 pounds and measures 9.25 x 5.9 x 0.75 inches. Uses the Android 5.1 (Lollipop) operating system and includes a suite of productivity and entertainment apps created or provided by Neo Access.\n\nOrbit Reader 20\nA 20-cell, 8-dot display and simple notetaker, whose low price is possible due to its unique refreshable cell technology and slimmed-down feature set. Includes Bluetooth support, an SD card slot, and a USB port, but no Wi-Fi. Weighs less than 1 pound, and battery life is listed in the specs as one day of use.\n\nPronto!\nPortable braille notetaker offered with either 18 or 40 refreshable braille cells. Both models feature braille input courtesy of an 8-dot braille keyboard, speech output, and a suite of apps such as a word processor, spreadsheet viewer, and more. The 40-cell version features a QWERTY keyboard that the user can swap in and out with the braille keyboard, even when the device is switched on.\n\nElectronic Notetaker (Speech)\nElectronic notetakers are small, portable devices for storing information with the use of braille or typewriter keyboards.

For your convenience, electronic notetakers with speech output only are listed separately here from electronic notetakers with braille and speech output.\n\nCurrent electronic notetakers are based on a variety of operating systems.

Can be used with a Duxbury Braille Board software (sold separately) on a nearby PC to translate text into correct grade 2 braille. Includes a one-year warranty. Service maintenance agreement available.\n\nBraille Printers\nBraille printers receive data from computer devices and emboss that information in braille onto paper through the use of solenoids that control embossing pins. Braille printers typically print on heavyweight paper and use up more pages for the same amount of information than pages printed on a regular printer. They are also slower and noisier. Interpoint printers are braille printers that emboss braille on both sides of a page. The price of a braille printer is directly related to the volume of braille it produces. Small-volume braille printers cost between $1,800 and $5,000 and large-volume ones may cost between $10,000 and $80,000.\n\nHere are some possible questions to ask when purchasing braille printers:\n\nHow does the printer connect to your computer?\nWhat is its embossing speed (measured in characters per second [CPS])?\nIs the height of the braille dots adjustable?\nIs the printer portable?\nHow loud is it? Is a soundproof case needed?\nDoes it print single-sided or double-sided?\nDo you need a printer that can produce both print and braille?\nBraille Express\nPortable interpoint braille printer that comes in two models\u2014Braille 100, which embosses at 100 characters per second, and the Braille 150, which embosses at 150 characters per second.

The braille file can then be sent to a braille printer or read on a braille display or a personal digital assistant.\n\nThe first step in converting a computer file into a braille document is to choose the type of braille required\u2014computer braille, a one-to-one representation of what appears on the computer screen; noncontracted (grade 1) braille, which consists of letters, numbers, and punctuation marks; or contracted (grade 2) braille, which includes contractions of common combinations of letters and words. To create a contracted braille file, a braille translation program takes the computer text file, inserts the proper contractions, and formats the document properly for the braille page. Some braille translation programs are available free of charge and may be downloaded from the Internet; other programs may cost up to $895.\n\nThe main questions to ask when purchasing braille translators are:\n\nIs the translator compatible with your computer\u2019s operating system?\nDo you need multiple languages?\nBrailleMaster\nBraille transcription software that can be used with any braille embosser, as well as with any ink printer for printing braille in visual form.

Automatically translates the entered music into braille, then displays it in a braille editor that supports six-key entry.\n\nCCTVs/Video Magnifiers\nA video magnifier, or closed-circuit television (CCTV) system, uses a stand-mounted or handheld video camera to project a magnified image onto a video monitor, a television (TV) screen, or a computer monitor. Cameras with zoom lenses provide variable magnification. In most of these systems, magnification level and focus are set after choosing a comfortable and functional working distance between the camera and the material to be viewed. Some systems use an auto-focus camera. Lower cost video magnifiers often use cameras that have a fixed focus and cannot vary magnification or camera-to-target distance. Most cameras also need their own light source.\n\nCameras that are mounted on a fixed stand require the reading material to be placed under the camera and moved across and down the page. To make the process of viewing easier, a table that is movable from the top of the page to the bottom and side to side (referred to as an x-y table) is used with most stand-mounted cameras. Stand-mounted cameras are particularly effective for handwriting because a hand can fit under the camera.\n\nIn contrast to stand-mounted cameras, handheld cameras are designed for bringing the camera to the material to be viewed. They can magnify almost anything within reach, including labels on packages of food and medicine. Handheld cameras are often on rollers, which make them easier to move across a flat working surface. Some manufacturers of video magnifiers that use handheld cameras offer a writing stand as an accessory.\n\nAll video magnifiers offer the option of viewing black letters on a white background or white letters on a black background. Controls for contrast and brightness are also standard. Many video magnifiers also provide other special on-screen features and controls including underlining or overlining of text. Some systems work jointly with a computer, offering the option of sharing the computer monitor. Color video magnifiers are useful for reading materials in which color is crucial, such as maps and color photographs. A radical departure in design from conventional video magnifiers is the use of head-mounted displays (HMD). They offer portability and new ways of viewing the display. Being able to capture and save an image is also a new function that has recently become available.\n\nTypically, video magnifiers that use a camera mounted on a fixed stand and x-y table are in the $1,800 to $4,000 price range. Lower cost video magnifiers that plug into a TV are in the $400 to $1,000 price range.\n\nAcrobat Ultra LCD\nVideo magnifier that features a 3-in-1 camera for seeing one's self up close, reading, and distance viewing.

        "output": "Content:\nScreen readers are software programs that allow blind or visually impaired users to read the text that is displayed on the computer screen with a speech synthesizer or braille display. A screen reader is the interface between the computer's operating system, its applications, and the user. The user sends commands by pressing different combinations of keys on the computer keyboard or braille display to instruct the speech synthesizer what to say and to speak automatically when changes occur on the computer screen. A command can instruct the synthesizer to read or spell a word, read a line or full screen of text, find a string of text on the screen, announce the location of the computer's cursor or focused item, and so on. In addition, it allows users to perform more advanced functions, such as locating text displayed in a certain color, reading pre-designated parts of the screen on demand, reading highlighted text, and identifying the active choice in a menu. Users may also use the spell checker in a word processor or read the cells of a spreadsheet with a screen reader.\n\nScreen readers are currently available for use with personal computers running Linux, Windows, and Mac, IOS, Android, and more. Each screen reader incorporates a different command structure, and most support a variety of speech synthesizers.

A user types what he or she wants to say and the text as well as responses appear on the braille display as contracted or uncontracted braille.\n\nFSTTY\nA deaf-blind telecommunications solution consisting of a modem and software installed on a PAC Mate. A deaf-blind person uses the braille display to review the text he or she enters and the text others send in reply. Can be used to place calls to anyone with a TDD. On a PAC Mate QWERTY keyboard, a deaf-blind person types in text and then reads the response on the braille display. Anyone using a braille keyboard must type uncontracted braille unless the recipient also has a braille display. Package includes a TTY modem and power supply, the FSTTY application CD, a serial cable, a CompactFlash\u00ae-to serial-adapter, a telephone cable, and leather carry case.\n\nDigital Talking Book Players (Hardware)\nTraditionally, Talking Books were played on records, and then, as the technology changed, on cassette tapes on specially adapted machines. Eventually, Talking Books became digital files on CDs or another device. These books allow users to skip directly to specific places in the book, insert bookmarks, and more.\n\nThere are two types of players for reading digital Talking Books\u2014stand-alone players and software players that are used on computers. The stand-alone machines are the easiest to learn to use, and they can be small and portable. They are also the most affordable players for people who do not own a computer. MP3 files and commercial music CDs can also be played on these players.\n\nDigital Talking Books are not really things that you can hold, although they usually come on a CD-ROM today. Rather, they are files, which may also be available on the web. To put it technically, digital Talking Books are well-organized collections of computer files produced according to specifications that are published in the standards that define them. They are a medium-independent information access-and-delivery technology\u2014the files can be stored on CD, in a directory, or on a memory card\u2014that is based on open standards, primarily the World Wide Web Consortium\u2019s (W3C) XML (Extensible Markup Language) and SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language), pronounced \u201csmile.\u201d\n\nA fully coded book in the DAISY (Digital Accessible Information System) format can have many levels of navigation, accessed by using the player\u2019s keypad or buttons. For example, Level 1 could be chapters, Level 2 could be subheadings within a chapter, and Level 3 could be paragraphs. Using the appropriate keys, the user can navigate forward or backward through the book using these levels. The user can also go to a particular page, navigate by phrase (as defined by the book\u2019s coding), or place a bookmark at a memorable passage or at the beginning of a section to be studied. Digital Talking Books can include both text and audio files.\n\nWhen digital Talking Books contain text, it is possible to send the text to a braille embosser or display it on a refreshable braille display or on a screen\u2014in any font and font size. It is also possible to check spelling and search for text the way one can now search on the web.\n\nNo longer does one have to wait for that long rewind or fast forward; digital Talking Book players take one forward or backward almost instantaneously. They also allow users to increase or decrease the speed of the reading using speech compression\u2014they cut the pauses between words rather than just increasing the speed at which the book is played. So, a favorite narrator will seem to be reading very quickly in his or her own human voice, instead of sounding high-pitched like a mouse.\n\nDigital Talking Books are a particular kind of electronic book\u2014the kind defined by and for people who are blind or otherwise print disabled to best meet their particular information access and reading needs. Digital Talking Books will not work on players that are not designed to play them.\n\nQuestions to ask when purchasing digital Talking Book players:\n\nDo you want a portable player or a software player that runs on your computer?\nDo you want a player that plays CDs or a player that plays files transferred directly from your computer?\nDo you want a full-featured player or is a player with some features enough?\nBook Port Plus\nA digital talking book player designed to support a wide variety of playback formats.

        "output": "Content:\nBraille displays provide access to information on a computer screen by electronically raising and lowering different combinations of pins in braille cells. A braille display can show up to 80 characters from the screen and is refreshable\u2014that is, it changes continuously as the user moves the cursor around on the screen, using either the command keys, cursor routing keys, or Windows and screen reader commands. The braille display sits on the user\u2019s desk, often underneath the computer keyboard.

        "output": "Content:\n\nJAWS 2025 Features\n\nFSCompanion: Your AI-Powered Assistant for Learning JAWS and Microsoft Applications\nWith so many features and keystrokes available between JAWS, Windows, and various Office apps, it can be challenging to locate the information you need to perform specific tasks. The new AI assistant, FSCompanion, lets you ask questions about JAWS and other applications and quickly provides the information without searching through multiple documents or web pages. \n\nFSCompanion has been trained using JAWS help and training data as well as support content from Microsoft. It currently does not contain data for ZoomText and Fusion, but support for these products will be available soon.\n\nFSCompanion can respond to questions about:\n- JAWS usage\n- Windows usage and navigation\n- Web browsing\n- Microsoft Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint\n\nTo open FSCompanion:\n- In JAWS, press the layered command, `INSERT+SPACEBAR`, followed by `F1`.\n- It is also located in the JAWS Help menu under Web Resources.\n- Alternatively, go to [FSCompanion.ai](http://FSCompanion.ai) from a PC or mobile device using your preferred web browser.\n\nOnce the FSCompanion page opens, press `TAB` to move to the edit field, type a question, and press `ENTER`. JAWS will automatically read the response. You can use `TAB`, `SHIFT+TAB`, or the ARROW keys to review answers. Use the \"New Conversation\" button to start a new topic or the \"Feedback\" button to submit any comments.\n\nExample questions to get started:\n- How do I change the JAWS volume?\n- How do I select cells in Excel?\n- How do I turn off the Preview Pane in Outlook?\n- How do I select text?\n- How do I set a PlaceMarker on a page?\n\nNote: FSCompanion is optimized for English. It has been trained with English documentation, so the keystrokes and terminology may not be accurate for other languages. Additional language support is coming soon.\n\nAutomatic Language Detection\nJAWS can automatically detect the language in use and adjust its voice based on the written language. This feature runs entirely on your computer and does not access the Internet. To enable this option:\n- Open Settings Center, expand the Text Processing group, and the Language Processing subgroup.\n- Press `SPACEBAR` on \"Detect Language\" to cycle through the available options and choose \"Based on AI predictions.\"\n\nIf JAWS does not automatically switch languages in an application, open Settings Center in the application and check the \"Detect Language\" option. This setting is off by default for some applications.\n\nEPUB Reading Improvements\nEPUB is a popular format for textbooks and digital publications. JAWS now includes support for EPUB files with navigation commands and region types:\n- Abstract, Acknowledgment, Afterword, Appendix, Bibliography, Chapter, Conclusion, Cover page, Dedication, Epilogue, Errata, Example, Foreword, Glossary, Index, Introduction, Notice, Part, Preface, Prologue, Table of Contents.\n\nAdditionally, EPUB navigation supports the `R` and `SHIFT+R` quick keys to move through region types. Page breaks are now announced with the command `DASH` to move to the next page. JAWS announces \"page\" followed by the number when encountering page breaks.\n\nAnnounce Work Week\nPress `CTRL+INSERT+F12` twice quickly to announce the current work week number.\n\nARIA and Web Improvements\n- When `INSERT+TAB` is pressed on a radio button, JAWS now reads the current button along with the group.\n- Improved interaction with graphical objects on web pages.\n- Corrected issue where radio buttons on a web page would not announce the selected position.\n- JAWS now properly announces separator elements, combo boxes, and headings with the `aria-labelledby` attribute.\n- Enhanced interaction with switch elements, table headers, and ARIA menus on web pages.\n- In Forms Mode, JAWS now announces labels for edit fields and eliminates extra announcements in some cases.\n\nGoogle Suite Improvements\n- In Google Docs, Braille users now find moving to spelling or grammar errors more reliable.\n- JAWS now reads deleted characters in Google Sheets correctly when using `BACKSPACE`.\n- Improved performance in Google Sheets and other Google apps like Docs, Slides, and Drive.\n- Correctly reads buttons in Google Drive setup on Windows 11.\n\nOffice Apps Enhancements\n- In Outlook on the web, JAWS loads New Outlook scripts for a better experience.\n- Corrected issues in Outlook where keystrokes like `ALT+1` to `ALT+6` for message headers now work as expected.\n- In Word, JAWS now reads alt text for graphics and announces changes to tables.\n- Consistency in Word's reading of comments and tables.\n\nJAWS Application Enhancements\n- If Screen Shade is enabled, Picture Smart AI now indicates that the image cannot be described while Screen Shade is on.\n- Picture Smart AI now supports languages like Icelandic, Macedonian, Albanian, and Croatian.\n- Improved responsiveness of the JAWS Scan and Touch Cursors.\n- Updated JAWS to run on the latest features of Microsoft .NET 8 Core.\n- Added support for Slovak language and improved voice switching for Chinese Vocalizer Expressive.\n\nOther Enhancements\n- JAWS now reads as expected when navigating Slack and Thunderbird.\n- In Adobe Reader DC, labels for edit fields and checkboxes are more consistently spoken and shown in Braille.\n- Fixed issues with JAWS keyboard functionality after using the Windows System Information utility.\n- Pressing `CTRL` to interrupt speech in Remote Incident Manager now works as expected.\n- JAWS now reads text in a Terminal window even if it's set to run on the Logon screen."

        "input": "https://www.afb.org/node/16207/optical-character-recognition-systems",
        "output": "Content:\nOptical character recognition (OCR) systems provide persons who are blind or visually impaired with the capacity to scan printed text and then have it spoken in synthetic speech or saved to a computer file. There are three essential elements to OCR technology\u2014scanning, recognition, and reading text.\n\nInitially, a printed document is scanned by a camera. OCR software then converts the images into recognized characters and words and creates temporary files containing the text\u2019s characters and page layout. The recognition process takes account of the logical structure of the language. An OCR system will deduce that the word \u201ctke\u201d at the beginning of a sentence is a mistake and should be read as the word \u201cthe.\u201d OCR systems also use a lexicon and apply spell-checking techniques similar to those found in many word processors. The synthesizer in the OCR system then speaks the recognized text. Finally, the information is stored in an electronic form. In some OCRs these temporary files can be converted into formats retrievable by commonly used computer software such as word processors, spreadsheets, and databases. A person who is blind or visually impaired can access the scanned text by using adaptive technology devices that magnify the computer screen or provide speech or braille output.\n\nCurrent generation OCR systems provide very good accuracy and formatting capabilities at prices that are up to ten times lower than a few years ago. The price for the most popular PC-based OCR systems is about $1,000. This does not include the personal computer and screen access equipment. Prices of self-contained OCR systems and those that come bundled with a PC range from $3,500 to $5,500.\n\nHere are some questions to ask when purchasing optical character recognition systems:\n\nDo you prefer a stand-alone OCR product or a software-based product?\nIs the software-based OCR system compatible with your computer\u2019s operating system?\nDo you require screen-reading capabilities in addition to the OCR?\nDo you require braille output?\nClearReader+ Advanced\nPortable text-to-speech and OCR reading and scanning device.

        "instruction": "Everything You Need To Know About Screen Readers | A.Checker",
        "input": "[https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/blog/screen-readers/](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/blog/screen-readers/)",
        "output": "Content:\nScreen readers have become an essential online tool for the visually impaired. A screen reader makes it possible to send emails, shop, and run apps, giving blind users equal access to online products and services.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about how screen readers work and the best options available today, this guide has all the information you need.\n\n\nWhat Are Screen Readers?\nScreen readers were designed for people with severe visual impairments, making it possible for them to fully engage with the web and other online applications. A screen reader works in conjunction with a computer\u2019s Operating System (OS), giving elements such as files, graphics, and menus more context.\nUsing a screen reader gives a user full access to the OS of their device, including common applications.\n\n\nWho Uses Screen Readers?\nScreen readers are used by anyone who is legally blind or has a severe visual impairment. If a website or mobile application can\u2019t be accessed due to a visual disability, screen readers help remove this barrier.\n\n\nHow Many People Use Screen Readers?\nA study by the National Federation of the Blind (1) shows that over 7 million people in America alone have some form of visual disability, which is why screen readers have become such a critical tool in the digital age.\n\nLet\u2019s look at another survey conducted by WebAIM (2). Of the 1,214 people who were asked whether they have a disability, 87.6% indicated they relied on a screen reader.\n\nThe majority of the respondents are between the ages of 21 and 40, with 88% of all respondents stating that they use a screen reader because of a disability.\n\nOver 71% of respondents use screen readers exclusively for audio output either on a laptop or mobile device.\n\nHow Do Screen Readers Work?\nScreen readers relay information in one of two ways:\n- Speech\n- Braille\n\nUsing Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities, a screen reader can instantly translate on-screen information into audio, making it easier for a user to engage with a website and its content. A TTS engine either comes bundled with a screen reader or it can be used as a separate device that\u2019s plugged into a computer.\n\nA screen reader can also be used with a Braille display, which has one or more rows of cells. These cells are formed into the shapes of characters, making it possible for someone with a visual impairment to understand what\u2019s on a screen without requiring audio. The Braille characters change as the screen display does.\n\nMost screen readers have both TTS and Braille functionality and work using keyboard commands. Using a keyboard, a user can read parts of a web page, open and close files, and carry out various tasks.\n\nThe keyboard shortcuts will differ depending on the operating system that\u2019s being used, so once someone understands how to operate a certain OS, they tend to stick with it.\n\n\nHow Do Screen Readers Read Symbols?\nSome screen readers can decipher certain symbols, but most others cannot.\nIf an uncommon symbol is used without any alternative text, most screen readers will simply skip over it or end up reading a sentence incorrectly.\nFor this reason, it\u2019s best practice for website and application owners to not use symbols and punctuation in a way that would make text unreadable and confusing. If symbols are used, it\u2019s essential to add alt text.\n\n\nHow Do Screen Readers Read Links?\nA screen reader will say the word \u201clink\u201d before it reads the text linked to a URL. This tells a user there is text that can be clicked on. It will also read each letter of a URL if it\u2019s not linked to a word or sentence, making it difficult for a user to understand.\nIt is best practice to use clear linked text that explains what a user could expect if they clicked on it. Wording like \"Click Here\" or \"Read More\" is too vague, and inserting an entire URL creates a poor experience.\n\n\nHow Do Screen Readers Read Emojis?\nScreen readers such as VoiceOver and TalkBack make it possible for visually impaired users to understand what emojis are being displayed. For example, the clapping hands emoji would be read out as \"clapping hands\" because of the alt text associated with it.\nAs you can imagine, text with too many emojis one after the other could read poorly and cause a frustrating experience, which is why limited emoji use is encouraged.\n\n\nHow Do Screen Readers Read Numbers?\nA screen reader will read a number as it is displayed. For example, 40% will be read out as \"forty percent.\" However, a phone number such as (703) 555-1212 will be read as \u201cseven hundred three (pause) five hundred fifty-five minus one thousand two hundred twelve.\u201d\nA phone number would need to have spaces between each number for it to be read out as single digits. However, displaying a phone number like this won\u2019t make sense to users who don\u2019t rely on screen readers, which is why it would need to be coded in.\n\nWhich Operating Systems Do Screen Readers Work With?\n\nScreen readers are available for all operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.\n- Speakup is one of the most popular screen readers for Linux because it runs on popular distributions such as Slackware and Debian.\n- VoiceOver, which uses the Cepstral TTS, is one of the top choices among MAC users.\n- For Windows users, Jaws and Dolphin, which are bundled with the ETI Eloquence and Orpheus TTS engines respectively, are some of the top picks.\n\nThe Best Screen Readers On the Market\nWhether you are looking for a screen reader for your device or you want to test your site using popular readers for ADA compliance purposes, here are some of the best options available today.\n- Apple Voice Over  \n  This industry-leading screen reader uses both audio and Braille to improve a user\u2019s online experience. The VoiceOver screen reader is designed to describe people, text, graphs, and more. Using audio descriptions, users can easily navigate their screens with a Bluetooth keyboard or touchscreen. There is even a visual trackball, making it possible to move from one area of the screen to the next. VoiceOver is available in 60 languages, and users can choose between multiple voice options.\n\n- OrCam Read 3  \n  Using the OrCam Read 3 handheld device, people with low vision can have any printed or digital document read aloud. What really sets this device apart is that it was created with AI assistance, making it possible to get answers to any content-related questions and summarize any length of text. There\u2019s also the option of turning your computer screen into OrCam\u2019s Smart Magnifier to engage with any type of text, handwritten documents, and even images.\n\n- NVDA  \n  Only available on Windows, this open-source screen reader is available in multiple languages and translates on-screen text to audio with ease. NVDA can be downloaded for free by anyone, ensuring more people have equal access to the web. However, it is possible to give a donation when downloading the reader. NVDA is only available for PCs running Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 and later.\n\n- Speakup  \n  Free for Linux users, Speakup gives you full access to all console programs in the Gnu/Linux OS. The SpeakUp Project is more than just a screen reader though, it\u2019s also a community of visually disabled users who enjoy writing useful software.\n\n- Jaws  \n  Another top option for Windows users, Jaws provides speech and Braille output for the most popular computer applications on your device. Jaws removes barriers, making it possible for blind and visually impaired people to navigate the web, write documents, fill out online forms, read emails, and more. Home, school, and business solutions are available, with licenses starting at $90 per year.\n\n- Emacspeak  \n  This text-to-speech interface is most often used for browsing and messaging and can be downloaded for free if Linux is your OS of choice. Audio formatting and full support for W3C\u2019s Aural CSS (ACSS) allows Emacspeak to produce rich aural presentations of electronic information. Manuals for installation and usage are readily available on the Emacspeak platform.\n\n- Dolphin  \n  Intelligent speech and braille technology make this screen reader ideal for fast, easy access to Microsoft Office and other Windows apps. Choose from a range of customizable speech settings and braille displays, connect a scanner to scan and read printed text, and explore your screen using just a keyboard. Pricing starts at $995 and includes 12 months of software maintenance.\n\n- ChromeVox  \n  If Chrome is your preferred browser, this screen reader extension has some handy TTS functionality that makes browsing that much easier.\n\n- Serotek System Access  \n  And lastly, if you need to work on sophisticated computer systems, Serotek\u2019s screen reader could be right for you. Single key operation, constant monitor refresh, a dedicated keypad, and overscan and underscan are just some of the features of this Linux screen reader, which can be downloaded for free.\n\n A Final Word\n\nScreen readers are here to stay, and we can only expect the features and capabilities to keep getting better as user preferences and technology evolve."

        "output": "Content:\nComputer Access for People Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision\nfindings from the 2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data release established that an estimated 26.9 million adult Americans (or about 10% of all adult Americans) reported they either \"have trouble\" seeing, even when wearing glasses or contact lenses, or that they are blind or unable to see at all.\n\nOf course if you (or a loved one) have recently experienced profound vision loss, these numbers are little more than mere statistics. We mention them here for one reason: to assure you that you are not alone. Vast resources\u2014human, technical, medical, and rehabilitative\u2014stand ready to assist you in regaining your independence, resuming your career or starting a new one, and, most importantly, increasing your enjoyment of life, friends, and family.\n\nIn this section we will focus on the technical resources that are available to those with visual impairments. We\u2019ll begin by describing one of the most profound technological achievements to have benefited sight-impaired individuals: the accessible personal computer.\n\nThis guide is organized into two main sections. The first section is for those with new visual impairments who are brand new to computers. There, we talk about all of the ways in which computers are helpful and useful, along with what to consider when purchasing a computer.\n\nfirst section:\nAccess for the Novice Computer User with a Visual Impairment\nIf you are a computer novice, fear not. In this part of the guide we will offer an overview of the many ways a computer can, through special software, be used by someone with a partial or complete visual impairment. We will discuss how to select the right personal computer for your lifestyle and needs, and talk a little bit about important differences between Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X, the two major operating systems for personal computers. By the end of Part I, you should have the information you need to purchase a computer with confidence.\n\nThe second section is for those with recent visual impairment who already own, and have some experience using, a personal computer. There we discuss the main components of accessibility and lay the groundwork for a productive and happy computing experience.\n\nsecond section:\nFor the Experienced Computer User with a New Visual Impairment\nThis section is designed for those who have some experience with computers and who are recently visually impaired, and for those computer novices with visual impairments who have recently purchased a computer with the help of the information in Part I of this guide. In Part II, we'll first take a look at which parts of the computing experience require accessibility solutions, then we'll introduce screen readers and screen magnifiers. Be sure to read why keyboarding and keyboard shortcuts are critical to accessible computing before launching into our detailed discussion of Windows and Apple accessibility settings and software.\n\nUsing a Computer With Low Vision or Without Sight\nYou may be asking yourself, \u201cHow is it possible to use a computer when I can no longer see the screen well enough to read the text or manipulate a computer mouse?\u201d The good news is that you can indeed operate a computer, even with absolutely no sight at all. As a sight-impaired individual, the difficulties you may encounter when learning to use or continuing to use a computer fall into just a few basic categories:\n\nAccessing the screen to determine the location of all the various menus and controls you will need to surf the Internet, create a document, read your e-mail, or use any other computer program.\nKeeping track of the constant flow of new screen information.\nUsing a computer mouse to navigate the screen and issue commands.\nConfirming that the information you enter into documents and fields is correct and in the right location.\nBelieve it or not, accomplishing any and all of the above poses no insurmountable challenges. How you can best accomplish these tasks will depend on your level of sight."
